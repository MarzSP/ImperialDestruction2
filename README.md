Work in progress!<br>
An object oriented adventure, written in Java. Using the HAN Yaeger Game Engine.<br>
Since creating this game in june 2024, i've learnt a fair amount and thought it was time to make a version 2. <br> Refactoring, reducing code smells, improving structure ect. <br>

Refactored:<br>
App<br>
Helper<br>
Package Scenes <br>
Package MenuBar <br>
Most of package Game <br>
New Package Obstacles with Abstract Obstacle <br> 
New Package Enemies, **not** yet refactored to interface <br>

Much more refactoring to go!<br>
